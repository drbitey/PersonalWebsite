Hi! This repository is for my personal website. I use it as a project to explore my own technical interests and share my hobbies- namely GIS and music

You'll notice that the main page hosts my "Song of the Day"- this is the main project, which has allowed me to learn a lot about the process of making an efficient workflow for a super dynamic project. I'm always working to make it better- from redesigning the layout of the site in 2022, creating a dynamic JSON system which allows for better control of entries in 2023, in the same year creating a wonderful tool for visualization of the spatial distribution of entries, and adding a better system for localization with translations courtesy of my great friends across the world in 2024- just to name a few. 

It's a very personal project which has been a part of my life through so much- starting with no real goal before the SotD when I was 15, through my transition from high school to college, outliving relationships, staying with me as I travelled the world, helping me learn about myself, and documenting my music taste change. This site is extremely important to me, it truly is my pride and joy. If you've come to read this, I appreciate you and hope you enjoy what I've made just as much as I enjoy working on it!

If you ever have suggestions- whether it be for code, song entries, or anything inbetween- please email me at *m.voltz04@gmail.com*, I am happy to listen!

Thanks so much,

*Mike*
