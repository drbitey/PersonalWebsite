				<h1>THOG WORLD</h1>
				<h3>2022 overview</h3>
				<span style="display:block;" class="text-centered">
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">2022 had a lot of stuff happen in thog world history so I wanted to write a short article summarizing stuff and showing data I put together over time</h4>
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">First off, <a href="https://thog.world/">thog.world</a> is DEAD. And <a href="https://thogg.us/">thogg.us</a> has taken its place. The old domain is gone for now because I didn't want to pay namecheap $30 for a shitpost site and so I simply did not and lost the domain, so bought another one for 99 cents instead. Just like with thog world, the domain name was chosen because I simply thought it was funny. Soon I should be able to buy the old domain back for cheap again but I'm not too stressed about it.</h4>
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">Also in a similar vain you may have noticed the layout of the front page of thog world has changed a lot. I simply changed it to what it is now because I thought it was funny and I will probably continue to change it a lot in the future. You can see the old layout <a href="https://www.thogg.us/archive/FirstCommit">here (feb 2020 archive)</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626001027/https://thog.world/">here (archive from before death)</a></h4>
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">NEXT, the Song of the Day is nearly at a year worth of entries. While there have been many weeks where I forget to update it, it's generally up to date or off by only a few days max. In this time I've been collecting data on each entry to be able to make some cool graphs and I think it was worth it</h4>
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">Firstly, and the part I spent the most time on: the maps. Every entry, I took information on where the artist was from/based in and made a map with these. Below is a heatmap using this data, and it's pretty clear that the distribution of SotD artists matches very closely the map of English speaker populations throughout the world. America has the most artists by far, at 106 (about 44% of entries), with the next being the UK at 33, followed by Canada at 16. </h4>

					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">The next graph below shows artists represented by their first-level subdivisions in countries. Unfortunately there were a few artists (less than 5) that I couldn't find information on the locations of outside of just countries, meaning this isn't complete. Either way, pretty cool. The first-level subdivision with the most artists represented is England, at 24, followed by New York and California tied for second with 15 artists each. Makes sense considering this is just the top 3 most populated English-speaking first-level subdivisions</h4><br>

				</div>
				<span style="display:block;" class="text-centered">
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">One thing that I think is important to add: yes I did cherrypick artists based on their location. What can I say, I like cool-looking maps and made some choices for entries based on how they would fill out the map. Cry about it</h4>
					<h4 style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px">If you're interested to see some more graphs, click <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/abae327d-4ed9-4adb-b000-f8c30f064c46">here</a> for a report I made on the extended listening history I got from Spotify or here for information just related to the Song of the Day. I had planned on collecting data on visitor info and similar stuff I could get about thog.world but it seems like cloudflare has deleted that so that's really cool and that means I don't have much else to post. <a href="https://youtu.be/4RMrCJDCF5Y">Thanks bye</a></h4>
