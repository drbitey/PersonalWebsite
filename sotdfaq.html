				<h1>SOTD FAQ</h1>
				<h3>Frequently asked questions and other information</h3>
				<h3><a href="https://mvoltz.com/sotd">Back to SOTD</a></h3><hr><br>
				<!--<h3 style="font-size:16px">(not updated daily)</h3><br>-->
				<h3>#1: The SOTD hasn't been updated today. How often are updates?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I aim to update the song of the day each day but sometimes I forget or am otherwise unable to update. At most, there will be one day without an update. All days will be uploaded eventually.</h4>
				<h3>#2: Can an artist/song be repeated?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">The only rule I keep for the song of the day is that a song cannot be used for more than one unique day. This is to encourage diversity of the music. However, I do not have a policy against repeating artists. As of the writing of this page, Sufjan Stevens has the most entries, at 6.</h4>
				<h3>#3: Is there a playlist/archive of past entries?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">Yes! Click <a style='color:#6300C6;' href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1nv3giLp6SAKUNuvXlSU51?si=0f326a759bf24e73">here</a> to be redirected to a Spotify playlist of all entries.</h4>
				<h3>#4: How many entries are there?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">As of <span id="h4_gray_day" style='color:#6300C6;'>today</span>, there is a total of <span id="h4_gray_cd" style='color:#6300C6;'>X</span> entries since February 5, 2022.</h4>
				<h3>#5: Can I suggest a song?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">Sure! I'm always open to listening to new music. I prefer not to give out my contact information, but most people who view this site are real-life friends of mine. If you have contact with me, feel free to shoot me a song anytime.</h4>
				<h3>#6: Are there any restrictions on chosen songs?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I do not have any explicit restrictions when choosing songs. However, I prefer using Spotify for the links and will generally list music from genres I actively listen to. Because of that, it's less likely for a song to be chosen if it isn't available on Spotify and/or is from a genre I don't generally listen to.</h4>
				<h3>#7: What is the objective of this site?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I started it for fun in February 2022 just to document what I was listening to. After I had a few entries, I realized I could use it to create some cool maps and diversify my music taste at the same time. See the charts link on the main page for some info on that!</h4>
				<h3>#8: What are the future goals of the project?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I would like to eventually get at least one artist from every country in the world. But since that's pretty optimistic, I'm starting out with the smaller goal of getting one artist from every state of the US and Canada. At the time of writing, the only places missing from this goal are the Northwestern Territories and Nunavut.</h4>
