quotes[1]="My only gripe is that I don't think there are Dwemer Ruins in Hammerfell.";

quotes[3]="is that elder scrolls online?";
quotes[4]="IIRC there's a lo-res terrain map of all of tamriel in every game, they just have to upres and populate it.";
quotes[5]="Judging by that architecture, I won't be spending much time in Hammerfell. I'll go in, do my business, and get out. Not a fan of it. But that's just Hammerfell. Everything else will probably pique my interest.";
quotes[6]="Correct me if I'm wrong here but I don't believe there is any basis to make some of the provinces off of, hence a complete map of tamriel is impossible.";
quotes[7]="Can't they just finish Skywind instead?";
quotes[8]="Reused textures in a ugly mishmash way with a brown tint. Not impressive in the slightest. Not to mention these projects have the most unrealistic goals, shady funding practices, and are general wastes if time for all involved. There is nothing in any screenshots, let alone this one, that warrants this popularity or praise. All so you can play and say 'Oh i remember that thing from 12 years ago'";
quotes[9]="No offense to the modder making this mod but, I have been following this mod wanting to play it since I heard about it's release and every time I think it's going to happen...bam nothing. This mod is taking forever in a day to make and it's only Bruma alone. The hype is a dying touch that you've long lost. By the time your finished with this mod, Bethseda will have long remade Morrowind AND Oblivion with revised graphics. Honestly speaking, if you don't give something for the gamer's to test soon, no one is going to care about this anymore. Either give up and let someone else that is able to finish this, or release a damn beta.";
quotes[10]="I don't even get what this is... is it people building this in mine craft or something... looks much too sharp for that";
quotes[11]="I just can't see this being worthwhile. Impressive feat that no one would play.";
quotes[12]="Bruma should honestly be pulled from the nexus and be forgotten about, together with the whole Beyond Skyrim thing. Bruma wouldn't have become any better if it was released at a later date. It needs to be overhauled. As of now, it's just a collection of stupid uninteresting fetch quests coupled with a location that is barely better than nothing. If I had worked on this project, I would rather pay the whole team to never mention my name again than have myself mentioned in the credits for this piece of work.";
quotes[13]="I'm gonna be devils advocate and say the map design (for lack of a better word) is very bad. This looks like another great concept but poor execution concerning the environment. You cut through multiple scenes revealing a many different areas with their own atmosphere, the problem here is that it is quite obvious not only one person is working on the map design, or, on the other hand it could be that that person or the people working in concert are extremely inconsistent in their work or have not streamlined their working progress. Many areas look stunning and in line with Elder Scrolls theme, more look very out of place and simply not visually pleasing.  But I really hope for your sake that this is just a prototype map. Seeing you presenting your first trailer now leads one to assume this is what you call (almost) finished content. I recognize you're doing it free of charge and I'm sure people who still play Skyrim or plan to play Beyond Skyrim will appreciate it very much. Still I see a plethora of things that could look worlds apart from what you showed in this trailer, by just reviewing and aesthetically improving, so I am just disappointed in what you came up with in this trailer. I am too lazy to give timestamps at this moment but I can talk more in depth if you wish. What I said might sound hars (non native speaker) but I've tried to make it as politically correct as possible, because I know I will get hate from uneducated Skyrim fanboys regardless.ï»¿";
quotes[14]="Just pretty pictures guys. Take it with a grain of salt. This probably will never release like every other project out there.ï»¿";
quotes[15]="No offense but you guys are so late... With such BAD graphics omg.. You could make it much faster without new soundtracks, buch of quest, story and other unnecessary stuff. Would be nice just having new maps, some enemies and stuff.. maybe some unvoiced quests. Would be totally fine by me. But having so much content now and so late.. Nah i'll pass. Maybe if it was 2016-2017 i would try it.ï»¿";
quotes[16]="unbelievable 90 bug reports and still not fixed. if you ask me this mod is a successful failure ";
quotes[17]="Like I'm gonna spend one cent on a Bethesda product. Do you know that they are memory thieves? The un-solicited downloads is reason number one to avoid these money grabbing goons. ";
quotes[18]="Excuse me, i just can't put this together. 7 projects, some of them bigger than the actual Skyrim. I mean, if these mods are not just plain maps, your words sound like total BS. I saw Bruma, yes. But Bruma was, as far as i know, a full team effort, not just bunch of guys, splitted in groups out of 2-3, coding independent projects in basement. Considering your team is not that big, when are you actually planning to release this set of expansion mods? like, 2050? Don't get me wrong, i respect all 'unpaid hobbys' (which are actually for CV or smth). Right now i just see you trying to promote yourself for a potential work in the studios, because you obviously put money in these 'video promotions'. I see you hired professional filmmakers to produce this promo. Usually, to presentate your work for the gaming community, you show 'actual footage', or maybe some sketches, or models. Right now, video includes only your face and empty words. I saw other videos too, most of them are very short and reveal nearly nothing. ";
quotes[19]="'E3 teaser trailer' First thing you see is Skyrim graphics. Fuck you, clickbait cunts. No one cares about ANOTHER FUCKING SKYRIM MOD. ";
quotes[20]="And it will never, ever be finished, just like all the other projects that try this. The Morrowind one, for example, has been being worked on for literally ten years, and an entirely new ES game with a 'new' (but not really) engine was released during that time frame, with another one on the way in the next few years. ";
quotes[21]="Shame they didn't make it in Morrowind.ï»¿";
quotes[22]="Both elder scrolls VI and beyond Skyrim will take at least another decade ";
quotes[23]="I Feel like it'll never get done lol. and when it does it'll be too outdated. ";
quotes[24]="I feel like this is going to be a quantity over quality kind of mod. I would much prefer if half the team worked on a single province and another half worked on another province rather than spreading out a bunch of random mod teams to work on different provinces. The quality is going to be INCREDIBLY inconsistent.ï»¿";
quotes[25]="I feel like this is too ambitious for its own good. I think we're gonna be missing out on a lot of potential content due to how unfocused the production will end up being. I can already tell that there are going to be glaring differences in the quality of each province and I'm kinda not looking forward to that.";
quotes[26]="I'm not too happy, because I need NASA's laptop for that.";
quotes[27]="Hopefully they don't turn into posers like the Skywind team and never release anything"
quotes[28]="Not that this isn't amazing but... Wouldn't time be better spent on making the mod than story based trailers? I'm really hyped for beyond skyrim but for me the fact nothings come out since bruma kinda sucks"
quotes[29]="looks dumb. Skyrim sucks."
quotes[30]="Don't be too excited for this series. SJWs have gotten their hands on at least the Morrowind installment and since they always gatekeep, they're bound to spread to every other and drive out differing opinions and viewpoints for diversity's sake. The result will be highly predictable questlines with a linear path that does not allow the player to 'do things the writers don't like.' For example, they removed slavery as an aspect of Dunmeri culture because 'slavery is wrong'."
quotes[31]="Is this fan made or a continuation of the MMO?"
quotes[32]="The dialogue sounds cringy as hell."
quotes[33]="wtf even is this? some kind of Skyrim expansion pack or mod? Just give us a god damn Elder Scrolls 6 for fuck's sake!"
quotes[34]="wowï»¿ so bad voice acting not Oblibion/Skyrim lore friendly at all"
quotes[35]="This mod doesn't have Oblivion feeling at all they should have copied Skyblivionï»¿ map"
quotes[36]="How shit are those graphics in 2019? Go back and fix your old as game engine Bethesda, then try selling us the same game concept you've been selling for years. At least you tried something a little different for 76, despite how much of a flop and failure it was, and catering for the audience, but at least it was a royal."
quotes[37]="Imagine those modders making a sex mod. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”"
quotes[38]="Feels like you're beating the already decomposed horse, just make a new game. You have the capacity and team for it."
quotes[39]="Aren't they running too much projects at once? Wouldn't it be better if they worked on one and released a mod in shorter intervals?"
quotes[40]="If you believe this mod will ever be released then I have a bridge to sell you."
quotes[41]="Pffft this looks exactly like Oblivion you haven't even got custom assets you just ripped them straight from TES4"

quotes[47]="You better not tease anything till you're ready to put out"
quotes[48]="I'm sure these guys need extra hands to make these rocks look less like old crappy assets no one wants to see anymore. They've done pretty much everything else. I guess I might expect to go down rather than climb up in Black Marsh as a general geographic idea but The Land Before Time scenarios are pretty ROCK solid. Fucking fix those rocks."
