Hi! This repository is for my personal website. I use it as a project to explore my own technical interests and share my hobbies- namely GIS and music

You'll notice that the main page hosts my "Song of the Day"- this is the main project, which has allowed me to learn a lot about the process of making an efficient workflow for a super dynamic project. I'm always working to make it better- from redesigning the layout of the site in 2022, creating a dynamic JSON system which allows for better control of entries in 2023, in the same year creating a wonderful tool for visualization of the spatial distribution of entries, and adding a better system for localization with translations courtesy of my great friends across the world in 2024- just to name a few. 

This site is extremely important to me, it truly is my pride and joy. If you've come to read this, I appreciate you and hope you enjoy what I've made just as much as I enjoy working on it!

If you ever have suggestions- whether it be for code, song entries, or anything inbetween- please email me at *m.voltz04@gmail.com*, I am happy to listen!
