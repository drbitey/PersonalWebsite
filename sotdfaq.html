				<h1>SOTD FAQ</h1>
				<h3>Frequently asked questions and other information</h3>

				<!--<h3 style="font-size:16px">(not updated daily)</h3><br>-->
				<h3>#1: The SOTD hasn't been updated today. How often are updates?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I aim to update the song of the day each day but sometimes I forget or am otherwise unable to update. Generally the maximum delay on updates is a day, but sometimes it can be as much as 4-5 days. All days will eventually get uploaded.</h4>
				<h3>#2: Can an artist/song be repeated?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">The only rule I keep for the song of the day is that a song cannot be used for more than one unique day. This is to encourage diversity of the music. However, I do not have a policy against repeating artists. As of the writing of this page, Sufjan Stevens has the most entries, at 6.</h4>
				<h3>#3: Is there a playlist/archive of past entries?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">As of the writing of this article, I have not yet made a playlist archiving past entries. I plan to in the future but it is uncertain when I will finish it. Hopefully by the end of 2023 this will be available.</h4>
				<h3>#4: How many entries are there?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray_cd">As of today, there is a total of X entries since February 5, 2022.</h4>
				<h3>#5: Can I suggest a song?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">Sure! I'm always open to listening to new music. I prefer not to give out my contact information, but most people who view this site are real-life friends of mine. If you have contact with me, feel free to shoot me a song anytime.</h4>
				<h3>#6: Are there any restrictions on chosen songs?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I do not have any explicit restrictions when choosing songs. However, I prefer using Spotify for the links and will generally list music from genres I actively listen to. Because of that, it's less likely for a song to be chosen if it isn't available on Spotify and/or is from a genre I don't generally listen to.</h4>
				<h3>#7: What is the objective of this site?</h3>
				<h4 id="h4_gray">I started it for fun in February 2022 just to document what I was listening to. After I had a few entries, I realized I could use it to create some cool maps and diversify my music taste at the same time. See the charts link on the main page for some info on that!</h4>
