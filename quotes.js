quotes[1]="My only gripe is that I don't think there are Dwemer Ruins in Hammerfell.";

quotes[3]="is that elder scrolls online?";
quotes[4]="IIRC there's a lo-res terrain map of all of tamriel in every game, they just have to upres and populate it.";
quotes[5]="Judging by that architecture, I won't be spending much time in Hammerfell. I'll go in, do my business, and get out. Not a fan of it. But that's just Hammerfell. Everything else will probably pique my interest.";
quotes[6]="Correct me if I'm wrong here but I don't believe there is any basis to make some of the provinces off of, hence a complete map of tamriel is impossible.";
quotes[7]="Can't they just finish Skywind instead?";
quotes[8]="Reused textures in a ugly mishmash way with a brown tint. Not impressive in the slightest. Not to mention these projects have the most unrealistic goals, shady funding practices, and are general wastes if time for all involved. There is nothing in any screenshots, let alone this one, that warrants this popularity or praise. All so you can play and say 'Oh i remember that thing from 12 years ago'";
quotes[9]="No offense to the modder making this mod but, I have been following this mod wanting to play it since I heard about it's release and every time I think it's going to happen...bam nothing. This mod is taking forever in a day to make and it's only Bruma alone. The hype is a dying touch that you've long lost. By the time your finished with this mod, Bethseda will have long remade Morrowind AND Oblivion with revised graphics. Honestly speaking, if you don't give something for the gamer's to test soon, no one is going to care about this anymore. Either give up and let someone else that is able to finish this, or release a damn beta.";
quotes[10]="I don't even get what this is... is it people building this in mine craft or something... looks much too sharp for that";
quotes[11]="I just can't see this being worthwhile. Impressive feat that no one would play.";
quotes[12]="Bruma should honestly be pulled from the nexus and be forgotten about, together with the whole Beyond Skyrim thing. Bruma wouldn't have become any better if it was released at a later date. It needs to be overhauled. As of now, it's just a collection of stupid uninteresting fetch quests coupled with a location that is barely better than nothing. If I had worked on this project, I would rather pay the whole team to never mention my name again than have myself mentioned in the credits for this piece of work.";
quotes[13]="I'm gonna be devils advocate and say the map design (for lack of a better word) is very bad. This looks like another great concept but poor execution concerning the environment. You cut through multiple scenes revealing a many different areas with their own atmosphere, the problem here is that it is quite obvious not only one person is working on the map design, or, on the other hand it could be that that person or the people working in concert are extremely inconsistent in their work or have not streamlined their working progress. Many areas look stunning and in line with Elder Scrolls theme, more look very out of place and simply not visually pleasing.  But I really hope for your sake that this is just a prototype map. Seeing you presenting your first trailer now leads one to assume this is what you call (almost) finished content. I recognize you're doing it free of charge and I'm sure people who still play Skyrim or plan to play Beyond Skyrim will appreciate it very much. Still I see a plethora of things that could look worlds apart from what you showed in this trailer, by just reviewing and aesthetically improving, so I am just disappointed in what you came up with in this trailer. I am too lazy to give timestamps at this moment but I can talk more in depth if you wish. What I said might sound hars (non native speaker) but I've tried to make it as politically correct as possible, because I know I will get hate from uneducated Skyrim fanboys regardless.";
quotes[14]="Just pretty pictures guys. Take it with a grain of salt. This probably will never release like every other project out there.";
quotes[15]="No offense but you guys are so late... With such BAD graphics omg.. You could make it much faster without new soundtracks, buch of quest, story and other unnecessary stuff. Would be nice just having new maps, some enemies and stuff.. maybe some unvoiced quests. Would be totally fine by me. But having so much content now and so late.. Nah i'll pass. Maybe if it was 2016-2017 i would try it.";
quotes[16]="unbelievable 90 bug reports and still not fixed. if you ask me this mod is a successful failure ";
quotes[17]="Like I'm gonna spend one cent on a Bethesda product. Do you know that they are memory thieves? The un-solicited downloads is reason number one to avoid these money grabbing goons. ";
quotes[18]="Excuse me, i just can't put this together. 7 projects, some of them bigger than the actual Skyrim. I mean, if these mods are not just plain maps, your words sound like total BS. I saw Bruma, yes. But Bruma was, as far as i know, a full team effort, not just bunch of guys, splitted in groups out of 2-3, coding independent projects in basement. Considering your team is not that big, when are you actually planning to release this set of expansion mods? like, 2050? Don't get me wrong, i respect all 'unpaid hobbys' (which are actually for CV or smth). Right now i just see you trying to promote yourself for a potential work in the studios, because you obviously put money in these 'video promotions'. I see you hired professional filmmakers to produce this promo. Usually, to presentate your work for the gaming community, you show 'actual footage', or maybe some sketches, or models. Right now, video includes only your face and empty words. I saw other videos too, most of them are very short and reveal nearly nothing. ";
quotes[19]="'E3 teaser trailer' First thing you see is Skyrim graphics. Fuck you, clickbait cunts. No one cares about ANOTHER FUCKING SKYRIM MOD. ";
quotes[20]="And it will never, ever be finished, just like all the other projects that try this. The Morrowind one, for example, has been being worked on for literally ten years, and an entirely new ES game with a 'new' (but not really) engine was released during that time frame, with another one on the way in the next few years. ";
quotes[21]="Shame they didn't make it in Morrowind.";
quotes[22]="Both elder scrolls VI and beyond Skyrim will take at least another decade ";
quotes[23]="I Feel like it'll never get done lol. and when it does it'll be too outdated. ";
quotes[24]="I feel like this is going to be a quantity over quality kind of mod. I would much prefer if half the team worked on a single province and another half worked on another province rather than spreading out a bunch of random mod teams to work on different provinces. The quality is going to be INCREDIBLY inconsistent.";
quotes[25]="I feel like this is too ambitious for its own good. I think we're gonna be missing out on a lot of potential content due to how unfocused the production will end up being. I can already tell that there are going to be glaring differences in the quality of each province and I'm kinda not looking forward to that.";
quotes[26]="I'm not too happy, because I need NASA's laptop for that.";
quotes[27]="Hopefully they don't turn into posers like the Skywind team and never release anything"
quotes[28]="Not that this isn't amazing but... Wouldn't time be better spent on making the mod than story based trailers? I'm really hyped for beyond skyrim but for me the fact nothings come out since bruma kinda sucks"
quotes[29]="looks dumb. Skyrim sucks."
quotes[30]="Don't be too excited for this series. SJWs have gotten their hands on at least the Morrowind installment and since they always gatekeep, they're bound to spread to every other and drive out differing opinions and viewpoints for diversity's sake. The result will be highly predictable questlines with a linear path that does not allow the player to 'do things the writers don't like.' For example, they removed slavery as an aspect of Dunmeri culture because 'slavery is wrong'."
quotes[31]="Is this fan made or a continuation of the MMO?"
quotes[32]="The dialogue sounds cringy as hell."
quotes[33]="wtf even is this? some kind of Skyrim expansion pack or mod? Just give us a god damn Elder Scrolls 6 for fuck's sake!"
quotes[34]="wow so bad voice acting not Oblibion/Skyrim lore friendly at all"
quotes[35]="This mod doesn't have Oblivion feeling at all they should have copied Skyblivion map"
quotes[36]="How shit are those graphics in 2019? Go back and fix your old as game engine Bethesda, then try selling us the same game concept you've been selling for years. At least you tried something a little different for 76, despite how much of a flop and failure it was, and catering for the audience, but at least it was a royal."
quotes[37]="Imagine those modders making a sex mod. ð¤ð¤ð¤"
quotes[38]="Feels like you're beating the already decomposed horse, just make a new game. You have the capacity and team for it."
quotes[39]="Aren't they running too much projects at once? Wouldn't it be better if they worked on one and released a mod in shorter intervals?"
quotes[40]="If you believe this mod will ever be released then I have a bridge to sell you."
quotes[41]="Pffft this looks exactly like Oblivion you haven't even got custom assets you just ripped them straight from TES4"

Looks & Plays EXACTLY! like every ES before it & can be Completely Soloed, again like every ES before it!... why be stuck in the Past over this game is beyond me..."
quotes[47]="You better not tease anything till you're ready to put out"
quotes[48]="I'm sure these guys need extra hands to make these rocks look less like old crappy assets no one wants to see anymore. They've done pretty much everything else. I guess I might expect to go down rather than climb up in Black Marsh as a general geographic idea but The Land Before Time scenarios are pretty ROCK solid. Fucking fix those rocks."
quotes[49]="not falling for it....wake up people this will never release.....it is nothing more than an eloborate hoax. #tamrieltruth"

quotes[54]="Some magic elder scrolls aladdin world? Get outta here"
quotes[55]="Lol no. I'm not a fan for fanfict story. I want the official story made from the company. These regions made by these people probably trash\nBut I appreciate their efforts to recreate the other regions based on some sources and with their imagination."
quotes[56]="probably trash\nBut I appreciate their efforts"
quotes[57]="Stop. Making. Videos. About. Mods. That. Takes. Too. Long. To. Make. And. Won't. Release. Ever."
quotes[58]="i dont really see the point in making this, its going to take years and people will just play es6 so its kinda pointless"
quotes[59]="Why would they have a team working on Atmora? That seems a waste to me. For starters, doesn't lore say that it's so cold there anyone dies? Like, that was suppose to be the whole reason the Nords fled to Skyrim. Secondly, people want to see Tamriel. So they could have had that team either help another team, or work on the places in Tamriel that currently have no dev team."
quotes[60]="i think luffy has more chace to find one piece before this project is done"
quotes[61]="How many Terabytes of data will I have to consume to get it ?"
quotes[62]="So WHERE do we find this mod? I cannot find it on steam, is there another place it may exist or is it 9 year old VAPORWARE that people are still talking about that cannot yet be downloaded?"
quotes[63]="Why tack stuff onto Skyrim? Why not go work on Tamriel Rebuilt instead?"
quotes[64]="Will never be released. Idoits spreading their resources too thin working on different areas etc. vapour ware like morrowblivion. cock teases"
quotes[65]="Looks boring, and drab as shit."
quotes[66]="Kind of bleak and colorless."
quotes[67]="No matter how much time, work and effort you pour into this, the fact will always remain, that recreating morrowind in skyrim is LAME.  Skyrim is a turd, and all you have done is roll it in glitter, and made a mockery of the greatness that is Morrowind.  You should be ashamed."
quotes[68]="i'm disappointed by the low quality conception of the new monsters / modified Trolls..some of them are a mix of mammoth, horker and troll ,  lack of imagination / creativity ? or it's just the creation engine limits !"
quotes[69]="A what about Valenwyd, Hammerfell and Sammerset islands. You have something ??"
quotes[70]="Too bad the beyind skyrim team doesn't consolidate man power and work on one land at a time"
quotes[71]="So after years of waiting the best they come up with is having you dodge snow storms in caves, walk through a barren wasteland and only fight creatures, no npcs..... Cant even go out at certain parts of the day.  Damn...  Im gonna pass on this one. Was expecting more. Hopefully they dont do this with any of their other lands."
quotes[72]="I love Beyond Skyrim but this worries me. Since the beginning of the project every dev has always said beyond skyrim is a landscapes and quest mod with no intention to change game play mechanics. Just like Bethesda's own DLC, it is consistent with the base game, and there are no major changes if any to mechanics or how the game is played. Now I could be wrong but by the sounds of this trailer the Atmora team intends to add a frost fall like mechanic to the game? That is what worries me. Mechanics like that have always been mod added features in elder scrolls games including skyrim of course. Doing this will make the mod feel just like any other mod, and not DLC. Bruma felt like Bethesda produced DLC, authentic and consistent. Adding this mechanic will be very inconsistent with skyrim, skyrim's DLC, and Beyond Skyrim's own projects. The mod will lack authenticity and not hold the real Bethesda made professional feeling like Bruma had, and the rest of Beyond Skyrim will certainly have."

quotes[74]="Please stop work here, tes 6 will do it! Finish other regions first! You dont start with Skyrim too :p"
quotes[75]="You guys are shameless teases."
quotes[76]="already going to have to mod there feet it seems"
quotes[77]="Like Oblivion Bruma? Why??"
quotes[78]="I have unfortunately fallen out of love with video games."
quotes[79]="Nice stream as usual. The only stain of shit is that guy who thinks he's funny and keeps interrupting everyone with his 'jokes' and 'impressions'. Dude. We get it. You think you're a good and funny voice actor. Now shut the fuck up and let us enjoy the stream."
quotes[80]="This is great indeed!  Bravo to Bethesda!  Bruma is one of those memorable cities in Oblivion.  The fact that they're bringing it back with the layout of city looking like it did back in the old Oblivion game is an achievement in itself.  And the soundtrack...if this is the soundtrack to it then they've done something truly magnificent!  THE soundtrack is everything!  Oblivion was most memorable due to the soundtrack while you were out exploring and dungeon crawling.  Do it and they will come."
quotes[81]="this mod is fucking shit"
quotes[82]="Shut the fuck up"
quotes[83]="Please tell me this isnt an online battle royal crap. Want to single player,  story mode!"
quotes[84]="I'll be as bug as bruma?"
quotes[85]="This comment section has way too much naivety. I cant believe you people actually think they will finish this project. It's really cool and all, but thinking they are going to actually implement all of cyrodiil is delusional at best. They've been working on this too long and bruma came out years ago. ES6 will be out long before this project is eve close to finished. I'd even be amazed, but tbh these guys stretch themselves out too thin by working multiple projects instead of focusing on one."
quotes[86]="Eso elsweyr better"
quotes[87]="Trailers and trailers and trailers. Will you guys ever finish and release something?"
quotes[88]="My knee had already healed completely..wow"
quotes[89]="this look like skyrim lmao"
quotes[90]="WHOOOOOOO SKYRIM TRASH HERE WE COME AHHHHHHHH"
quotes[91]="MAKE IT A JUNGLE YOU COWARDS"
quotes[92]="i dont care about this!!! I WANT NEW FALLOUT!!!!"
quotes[93]="Fake"
quotes[94]="... and  Bugthe$da will break this mod with Creation Club updates until the creators give up and stop updating it. oh joy. :("
quotes[95]="Beyond Skyrim is a bunch of scammers. Ever wondered why there is no content for Skyrim? Just go to the Nexus. There is no fucking content for Skyrim. Retextures and overhauls are not new content. In Oblivion you could visit the other provinces: Valenwood, Hammerfell, Vvardenfell, Elsweyr, even Skyrim was there. Heck, there are even two versions of Valenwood, so prolific and dedicated Oblivion mod authors were. In Skyrim you dont have any of it, because mod authors were either convinced or coopted to join the BS team, or were silenced/discouraged with accusations of theft and takedowns. Its a fucking mafia, which in Oblivion was called the Silgrad Tower project. This project was never released, they turned it into Beyond Skyrim. And they are going to do the same when TES VI is out. Now how you going to convince a skybaby, who never played the other games, of how great modding was in the past, and how fucking miserable is now? This all thanks to this corporativism which plagues the Nexus, with its cliques dictating what can and what cannot be released. In other words: they 'copyrighted' Tamriel, and we are NEVER going to see it, because they are going to port to TES VI, like they did before. Keep waiting 30 years for their 'projects' which are NEVER going to be released, soyboys."
quotes[96]="Taking too long ! Rigmor of bruma is better than bruma: beyond Skyrim, reason1: rigmor had better questline 2: rigmor provided more large and explorable map ! TOO MUCH DELAY PROJECT!"
quotes[97]="Because of you modders ,enjoy delay TES6 :"
quotes[98]="This project isn't new, and it's pretty much dead. How beyond Skyrim has it gone? It's pretty much just the Nord town of Cyrodil. That town is  the least beyond Skyrim place you can go to in all of the provinces of Tamriel."
quotes[99]="uh ... excuse me but this is abused. How did you get to play cyrodiil ?, in France we are impatently awaiting this mod, and you disgusted us there it is a joke."
quotes[100]="stop making these videos if this shit is unplayable and wont be released until 2027"

quotes[105]="Well i can tel you this! This project and similar projects wil never see the light of day! Dont wait for them and continue with  your life!"
quotes[106]="It's unfortunate that the management of this project is so poor. Take it from anybody who has worked on this project, there is absolutely no direction. That's why it's taken over 7 years and there are absolutely zero completed provinces (not even Atmora or Roscrea). The only people who know their roles and complete their tasks are the composers, hence why Beyond Skyrim has become little more than a music-to-study-to channel."
